# Lab2-ARTI308
This dataset contains information about 4,500 employees, including their work habits, AI tool usage, productivity levels, and work-life balance indicators. The goal of this project is to analyze how workplace and productivity-related factors influence employee burnout risk. The problem is framed as a regression task, since the objective is to predict the continuous numerical variable burnout_risk_score based on features such as experience years, AI tool usage hours per week, task automation percentage, manual work hours, meeting hours, and work-life balance score. By modeling the relationship between these features and burnout risk, the project aims to better understand how modern productivity environments and AI integration impact employee well-being. The dataset contains 4,500 records and 15 features in tabular format and was loaded and inspected using Pandas in Google Colab.
