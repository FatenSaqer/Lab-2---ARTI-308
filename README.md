# Lab2-ARTI308
This dataset contains information about 4,500 employees, including their work habits, AI tool usage, productivity levels, and work-life balance indicators. The goal is to analyze how these workplace and productivity-related factors influence employee burnout risk.

The problem is framed as a regression task, where the objective is to predict the continuous variable burnout_risk_score based on features such as experience years, AI tool usage hours per week, task automation percentage, manual work hours, meeting hours, and work-life balance score.

By modeling the relationship between these features and burnout risk, the project aims to better understand how modern productivity environments and AI integration impact employee well-being.
